Pycairo Documentation README
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains the reStructuredText (reST) sources to the Pycairo
documentation.

Options for accessing pycairo documentation:
1. Read the documentation online at http://cairographics.org
   - is not available yet, but it should be there eventually.

2. Download the latest 'pycairo-x.x.x-docs-html.tar.gz' prebuilt documents
from http://www.cairographics.org/releases/. Uncompress the docs and point
your browser at the index.html file.

3. Build the documentation yourself - the hardest option, see details below.


Building the docs
=================
You need to install Python 2.4 or higher; the toolset used to build the docs are
written in Python.  The toolset used to build the documentation is called
*Sphinx*, it is not included in this tree, but maintained separately in the
Python Subversion repository.  Also needed are Jinja, a templating engine
(included in Sphinx as a Subversion external), and optionally Pygments, a code
highlighter.


Using make
----------
   make html

Available make targets are:

 * "html", which builds standalone HTML files for offline viewing.

 * "htmlhelp", which builds HTML files and a HTML Help project file usable to
   convert them into a single Compiled HTML (.chm) file -- these are popular
   under Microsoft Windows, but very handy on every platform.

   To create the CHM file, you need to run the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop
   over the generated project (.hhp) file.

 * "latex", which builds LaTeX source files that can be run with "pdflatex"
   to produce PDF documents.

 * "text", which builds a plain text file for each source file.

 * "linkcheck", which checks all external references to see whether they are
   broken, redirected or malformed, and outputs this information to stdout
   as well as a plain-text (.txt) file.

 * "changes", which builds an overview over all versionadded/versionchanged/
   deprecated items in the current version. This is meant as a help for the
   writer of the "What's New" document.

 * "pydoc-topics", which builds a Python module containing a dictionary
   with plain text documentation for the labels defined in
   `tools/sphinxext/pyspecific.py` -- pydoc needs these to show topic
   and keyword help.

A "make update" updates the Subversion checkouts in `tools/`.


Without make
------------

You'll need to checkout the Sphinx package to the `tools/` directory::

   svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools/trunk/sphinx tools/sphinx

Then, you need to install Docutils 0.4 (the SVN snapshot won't work), either
by checking it out via ::

   svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/external/docutils-0.4/docutils tools/docutils

or by installing it from http://docutils.sf.net/.

You can optionally also install Pygments, either as a checkout via ::

   svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/external/Pygments-0.9/pygments tools/pygments

or from PyPI at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments.


Then, make an output directory, e.g. under `build/`, and run ::

   python tools/sphinx-build.py -b<builder> . build/<outputdirectory>

where `<builder>` is one of html, web or htmlhelp (for explanations see the make
targets above).
