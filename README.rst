Pycairo is a Python module providing bindings for the `cairo graphics library
<https://cairographics.org/>`__.

The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as
possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in
a more ‘Pythonic’ way.

Features of the Pycairo bindings:

* Provides an object oriented interface to cairo.
* Queries the error status of objects and translates them to exceptions.
* Provides a C API that can be used by other Python extensions.

Pycairo depends on **cairo >= 1.14** (the 1.13 git snapshot present in Ubuntu
14.04 works as well) and works with **Python 2.7+** as well as **Python
3.3+**. Pycairo, including this documentation, is licensed under the
**LGPLv2.1** as well as the **MPLv1.1**.

If Pycairo is not what you need, have a look at `cairocffi
<https://cairocffi.readthedocs.io>`__, which is an API compatible package
using `cffi <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/>`__ or `Qahirah
<https://github.com/ldo/qahirah>`__, which is using `ctypes
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`__ and provides a more
"pythonic" API with less focus on matching the cairo C API.
