        Sets the Pattern’s transformation matrix to matrix. This matrix is a transformation from user space to pattern space.

        When a Pattern is first created it always has the identity matrix for its transformation matrix, which means that pattern space is initially identical to user space.

        Important: Please note that the direction of this transformation matrix is from user space to pattern space. This means that if you imagine the flow from a Pattern to user space (and on to device space), then coordinates in that flow will be transformed by the inverse of the Pattern matrix.

        For example, if you want to make a Pattern appear twice as large as it does by default the correct code to use is:
        >>> matrix = cairo.Matrix(xx=0.5,yy=0.5)
        >>> pattern.set_matrix(matrix)

        Meanwhile, using values of 2.0 rather than 0.5 in the code above would cause the Pattern to appear at half of its default size.

class Glyph(Tuple[int, float, float]):
    """
    New in version 1.15: In prior versions a (int, float, float) tuple was used instead of `Glyph`.

    The `Glyph` holds information about a single glyph when drawing or measuring text. A font is (in simple terms) a collection of shapes used to draw text. A glyph is one of these shapes. There can be multiple glyphs for a single character (alternates to be used in different contexts, for example), or a glyph can be a ligature of multiple characters. Cairo doesn’t expose any way of converting input text into glyphs, so in order to use the Cairo interfaces that take arrays of glyphs, you must directly access the appropriate underlying font system.

    Note that the offsets given by x and y are not cumulative. When drawing or measuring text, each glyph is individually positioned with respect to the overall origin

    Parameters
    ----------
    >>> index (int)\n
    Glyph index in the font. The exact interpretation of the glyph index depends on the font technology being used.
    >>> x (float)\n
    The offset in the X direction between the origin used for drawing or measuring the string and the origin of this glyph.
    >>> y (float)\n
    The offset in the Y direction between the origin used for drawing or measuring the string and the origin of this glyph.

    New in version 1.15.

    The `TextCluster` structure holds information about a single text cluster. A text cluster is a minimal mapping of some glyphs corresponding to some UTF-8 text.

    For a cluster to be valid, both `num_bytes` and `num_glyphs` should be non-negative, and at least one should be non-zero. Note that clusters with zero glyphs are not as well supported as normal clusters. For example, PDF rendering applications typically ignore those clusters when PDF text is being selected.

    See `Context.show_text_glyphs()` for how clusters are used in advanced text operations.

    Parameters

    New in version 1.15: In prior versions a (float, float, float, float, float, float) tuple was used instead of `TextExtents`.

    The `TextExtents` class stores the extents of a single glyph or a string of glyphs in user-space coordinates. Because text extents are in user-space coordinates, they are mostly, but not entirely, independent of the current transformation matrix. If you call `context.scale(2.0, 2.0)`, text will be drawn twice as big, but the reported text extents will not be doubled. They will change slightly due to hinting (so you can’t assume that metrics are independent of the transformation matrix), but otherwise will remain unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    >>> x_bearing (float)\n
    The horizontal distance from the origin to the leftmost part of the glyphs as drawn. Positive if the glyphs lie entirely to the right of the origin.
    >>> y_bearing (float)\n
    The vertical distance from the origin to the topmost part of the glyphs as drawn. Positive only if the glyphs lie completely below the origin; will usually be negative.
    >>> width (float)\n

        Create a new surface that is a rectangle within the target surface. All operations drawn to this surface are then clipped and translated onto the target surface. Nothing drawn via this sub-surface outside of its bounds is drawn onto the target surface, making this a useful method for passing constrained child surfaces to library routines that draw directly onto the parent surface, i.e. with no further backend allocations, double buffering or copies.

        Set the horizontal and vertical resolution for image fallbacks.

        When certain operations aren’t supported natively by a backend, cairo will fallback by rendering operations to an image and then overlaying that image onto the output. For backends that are natively vector-oriented, this function can be used to set the resolution used for these image fallbacks, (larger values will result in more detailed images, but also larger file sizes).

        Some examples of natively vector-oriented backends are the ps, pdf, and svg backends.

        For backends that are natively raster-oriented, image fallbacks are still possible, but they are always performed at the native device resolution. So this function has no effect on those backends.

        Note: The fallback resolution only takes effect at the time of completing a page (with `Context.show_page()` or `Context.copy_page()`) so there is currently no way to have more than one fallback resolution in effect on a single page.

        The default fallback resoultion is 300 pixels per inch in both dimensions.

    def arc(self, xc: float, yc: float, radius: float, angle1: float, angle2: float) -> None:
        """
        Adds a circular arc of the given radius to the current path. The arc is centered at (xc, yc), begins at `angle1` and proceeds in the direction of increasing angles to end at `angle2`. If `angle2` is less than `angle1` it will be progressively increased by `2*PI` until it is greater than `angle1`.

        If there is a current point, an initial line segment will be added to the path to connect the current point to the beginning of the arc. If this initial line is undesired, it can be avoided by calling `Context.new_sub_path()` before calling `Context.arc()`.

        Angles are measured in radians. An angle of 0.0 is in the direction of the positive X axis (in user space). An angle of `PI/2.0 radians (90 degrees)` is in the direction of the positive Y axis (in user space). Angles increase in the direction from the positive X axis toward the positive Y axis. So with the default transformation matrix, angles increase in a clockwise direction.

        To convert from degrees to radians, use `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`.

        This function gives the arc in the direction of increasing angles; see `Context.arc_negative()` to get the arc in the direction of decreasing angles.

        The arc is circular in user space. To achieve an elliptical arc, you can scale the current transformation matrix by different amounts in the X and Y directions. For example, to draw an ellipse in the box given by x, y, width, height:

        The behavior of `close_path()` is distinct from simply calling `Context.line_to()` with the equivalent coordinate in the case of stroking. When a closed sub-path is stroked, there are no caps on the ends of the sub-path. Instead, there is a line join connecting the final and initial segments of the sub-path.

This can simplify path processing in some cases as it may not be necessary to save the “last move_to point” during processing as the MOVE_TO immediately after the CLOSE_PATH will provide that point.

        Specifically, this means that zero-area sub-paths such as `Context.move_to()`; `Context.line_to()` segments, (even degenerate cases where the coordinates to both calls are identical), will be considered as contributing to the extents. However, a lone `Context.move_to()` will not contribute to the results of `Context.path_extents()`.

        This group functionality can be convenient for performing intermediate compositing. One common use of a group is to render objects as opaque within the group, (so that they occlude each other), and then blend the result with translucence onto the destination.

        Groups can be nested arbitrarily deep by making balanced calls to `Context.push_group()`/`Context.pop_group()`. Each call pushes/pops the new target group onto/from a stack.

        Note: The `select_font_face()` function call is part of what the cairo designers call the “toy” text API. It is convenient for short demos and simple programs, but it is not expected to be adequate for serious text-using applications.

        Selects a family and style of font from a simplified description as a family name, slant and weight. Cairo provides no operation to list available family names on the system (this is a “toy”, remember), but the standard CSS2 generic family names, (“serif”, “sans-serif”, “cursive”, “fantasy”, “monospace”), are likely to work as expected.

        For “real” font selection, see the font-backend-specific `font_face_create` functions for the font backend you are using. (For example, if you are using the freetype-based cairo-ft font backend, see `cairo_ft_font_face_create_for_ft_face()` or `cairo_ft_font_face_create_for_pattern()`.) The resulting font face could then be used with `cairo_scaled_font_create()` and `cairo_set_scaled_font()`.

        Similarly, when using the “real” font support, you can call directly into the underlying font system, (such as fontconfig or freetype), for operations such as listing available fonts, etc.

        It is expected that most applications will need to use a more comprehensive font handling and text layout library, (for example, pango), in conjunction with cairo.

        If text is drawn without a call to `select_font_face()`, (nor `set_font_face()` nor `set_scaled_font()`), the default family is platform-specific, but is essentially “sans-serif”. Default slant is `cairo.FontSlant.NORMAL`, and default weight is cairo.`FontWeight.NORMAL`.

        Each “on” segment will have caps applied as if the segment were a separate sub-path. In particular, it is valid to use an “on” length of 0.0 with `cairo.LineCap.ROUND` or `cairo.LineCap.SQUARE` in order to distributed dots or squares along a path.

        Note: The length values are in user-space units as evaluated at the time of stroking. This is not necessarily the same as the user space at the time of `set_dash()`.

        This is a convenience function for creating a pattern from a Surface and setting it as the source in `Context` with `set_source()`.

        The x and y parameters give the user-space coordinate at which the surface origin should appear. (The surface origin is its upper-left corner before any transformation has been applied.) The x and y patterns are negated and then set as translation values in the pattern matrix.

        Other than the initial translation pattern matrix, as described above, all other pattern attributes, (such as its extend mode), are set to the default values as in `SurfacePattern`. The resulting pattern can be queried with `get_source()` so that these attributes can be modified if desired, (eg. to create a repeating pattern with `Pattern.set_extend()`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        >>> surface (cairo.Surface)\n
        A `Surface` to be used to set the source pattern.

A larger value will give better performance, a smaller value, better appearance. (Reducing the value from the default value of 0.1 is unlikely to improve appearance significantly.) The accuracy of paths within Cairo is limited by the precision of its internal arithmetic, and the prescribed tolerance is restricted to the smallest representable internal value.

        A drawing operator that generates the shape from a string of text, rendered according to the current font_face, font_size (font_matrix), and font_options.

        This function first computes a set of glyphs for the string of text. The first glyph is placed so that its origin is at the current point. The origin of each subsequent glyph is offset from that of the previous glyph by the advance values of the previous glyph.

        After this call the current point is moved to the origin of where the next glyph would be placed in this same progression. That is, the current point will be at the origin of the final glyph offset by its advance values. This allows for easy display of a single logical string with multiple calls to `show_text()`.

        Note: The `show_text()` function call is part of what the cairo designers call the “toy” text API. It is convenient for short demos and simple programs, but it is not expected to be adequate for serious text-using applications. See `show_glyphs()` for the “real” text display API in cairo.

        A drawing operator that strokes the current path according to the current line width, line join, line cap, and dash settings. After `stroke()`, the current path will be cleared from the cairo context. See `set_line_width()`, `set_line_join()`, `set_line_cap()`, `set_dash()`, and `stroke_preserve()`.

        Note: Degenerate segments and sub-paths are treated specially and provide a useful result. These can result in two different situations:

        1. Zero-length “on” segments set in `set_dash()`. If the cap style is `cairo.LineCap.ROUND` or `cairo.LineCap.SQUARE` then these segments will be drawn as circular dots or squares respectively. In the case of `cairo.LineCap.SQUARE`, the orientation of the squares is determined by the direction of the underlying path.

        2. A sub-path created by `move_to()` followed by either a `close_path()` or one or more calls to `line_to()` to the same coordinate as the `move_to()`. If the cap style is `cairo.LineCap.ROUND` then these sub-paths will be drawn as circular dots. Note that in the case of `cairo.LineCap.SQUARE` a degenerate sub-path will not be drawn at all, (since the correct orientation is indeterminate).

        In no case will a cap style of `cairo.LineCap.BUTT` cause anything to be drawn in the case of either degenerate segments or sub-paths.

    def stroke_extents(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]:

        Computes a bounding box in user coordinates covering the area that would be affected, (the “inked” area), by a `stroke()` operation given the current path and stroke parameters. If the current path is empty, returns an empty rectangle (0, 0, 0, 0). Surface dimensions and clipping are not taken into account.

        Note that if the line width is set to exactly zero, then `stroke_extents()` will return an empty rectangle. Contrast with `path_extents()` which can be used to compute the non-empty bounds as the line width approaches zero.

        Note that `stroke_extents()` must necessarily do more work to compute the precise inked areas in light of the stroke parameters, so `path_extents()` may be more desirable for sake of performance if non-inked path extents are desired.

        Note that whitespace characters do not directly contribute to the size of the rectangle (`extents.width` and `extents.height`). They do contribute indirectly by changing the position of non-whitespace characters.

        New in version 1.15.

        This operation has rendering effects similar to `Context.show_glyphs()` but, if the target surface supports it, uses the provided text and cluster mapping to embed the text for the glyphs shown in the output. If the target does not support the extended attributes, this function acts like the basic `Context.show_glyphs()` as if it had been passed `glyphs`.

        The mapping between `utf8` and `glyphs` is provided by a list of `clusters`. Each cluster covers a number of text bytes and glyphs, and neighboring clusters cover neighboring areas of `utf8` and glyphs . The clusters should collectively cover utf8 and glyphs in entirety.

        The first cluster always covers bytes from the beginning of utf8 . If `cluster_flags` do not have the `TextClusterFlags.BACKWARD` set, the first cluster also covers the beginning of glyphs , otherwise it covers the end of the glyphs array and following clusters move backward.

    Mesh patterns are tensor-product patch meshes (type 7 shadings in PDF).

    A tensor-product patch is defined by 4 Bézier curves (side 0, 1, 2, 3) and by 4 additional control points (P0, P1, P2, P3) that provide further control over the patch and complete the definition of the tensor-product patch. The corner C0 is the first point of the patch.

    Each patch is constructed by first calling `begin_patch()`, then `move_to()` to specify the first point in the patch (C0). Then the sides are specified with calls to `curve_to()` and `line_to()`.

    The four additional control points (P0, P1, P2, P3) in a patch can be specified with `set_control_point()`.

    At each corner of the patch (C0, C1, C2, C3) a color may be specified with `set_corner_color_rgb()` or `set_corner_color_rgba()`. Any corner whose color is not explicitly specified defaults to transparent black.

    A Coons patch is a special case of the tensor-product patch where the control points are implicitly defined by the sides of the patch. The default value for any control point not specified is the implicit value for a Coons patch, i.e. if no control points are specified the patch is a Coons patch.

    A triangle is a special case of the tensor-product patch where the control points are implicitly defined by the sides of the patch, all the sides are lines and one of them has length 0, i.e. if the patch is specified using just 3 lines, it is a triangle. If the corners connected by the 0-length side have the same color, the patch is a Gouraud-shaded triangle.

    Patches may be oriented differently to the above diagram. For example the first point could be at the top left. The diagram only shows the relationship between the sides, corners and control points. Regardless of where the first point is located, when specifying colors, corner 0 will always be the first point, corner 1 the point between side 0 and side 1 etc.

    Calling `end_patch()` completes the current patch. If less than 4 sides have been defined, the first missing side is defined as a line from the current point to the first point of the patch (C0) and the other sides are degenerate lines from C0 to C0. The corners between the added sides will all be coincident with C0 of the patch and their color will be set to be the same as the color of C0.

    Additional patches may be added with additional calls to `begin_patch()`/`end_patch()`.

    >>> pattern.end_patch()

    When two patches overlap, the last one that has been added is drawn over the first one.

    When a patch folds over itself, points are sorted depending on their parameter coordinates inside the patch. The v coordinate ranges from 0 to 1 when moving from side 3 to side 1; the u coordinate ranges from 0 to 1 when going from side 0 to side

    Points with higher v coordinate hide points with lower v coordinate. When two points have the same v coordinate, the one with higher u coordinate is above. This means that points nearer to side 1 are above points nearer to side 3; when this is not sufficient to decide which point is above (for example when both points belong to side 1 or side 3) points nearer to side 2 are above points nearer to side 0.

    For a complete definition of tensor-product patches, see the PDF specification (ISO32000), which describes the parametrization in detail.

    Note: The coordinates are always in pattern space. For a new pattern, pattern space is identical to user space, but the relationship between the spaces can be changed with `Pattern.set_matrix()`.

        Emit a comment into the PostScript output for the given surface.

        The comment is expected to conform to the PostScript Language Document Structuring Conventions (DSC). Please see that manual for details on the available comments and their meanings. In particular, the %%IncludeFeature comment allows a device-independent means of controlling printer device features. So the PostScript Printer Description Files Specification will also be a useful reference.

        The comment string must begin with a percent character (%) and the total length of the string (including any initial percent characters) must not exceed 255 characters. Violating either of these conditions will place PSSurface into an error state. But beyond these two conditions, this function will not enforce conformance of the comment with any particular specification.

        The comment string should not have a trailing newline.

        The DSC specifies different sections in which particular comments can appear. This function provides for comments to be emitted within three sections: the header, the Setup section, and the PageSetup section. Comments appearing in the first two sections apply to the entire document while comments in the BeginPageSetup section apply only to a single page.

        For comments to appear in the header section, this function should be called after the surface is created, but before a call to `dsc_begin_setup()`.

        For comments to appear in the Setup section, this function should be called after a call to `dsc_begin_setup()` but before a call to `dsc_begin_page_setup()`.

        For comments to appear in the PageSetup section, this function should be called after a call to `dsc_begin_page_setup()`.

        Note that it is only necessary to call `dsc_begin_page_setup()` for the first page of any surface. After a call to `Context.show_page()` or `Context.copy_page()` comments are unambiguously directed to the PageSetup section of the current page. But it doesn’t hurt to call this function at the beginning of every page as that consistency may make the calling code simpler.

        As a final note, cairo automatically generates several comments on its own. As such, applications must not manually generate any of the following comments:

        Header section: %!PS-Adobe-3.0, %Creator, %CreationDate, %Pages, %BoundingBox, %DocumentData, %LanguageLevel, %EndComments.

        Setup section: %BeginSetup, %EndSetup

        PageSetup section: %BeginPageSetup, %PageBoundingBox, %EndPageSetup.

        Other sections: %BeginProlog, %EndProlog, %Page, %Trailer, %EOF

        Here is an example sequence showing how this function might be used:

    Creates a new user pattern for providing pixel data.

    Use the setter functions to associate callbacks with the returned pattern.

    New in version 1.15.

    The raster source provides the ability to supply arbitrary pixel data whilst rendering. The pixels are queried at the time of rasterisation by means of user callback functions, allowing for the ultimate flexibility. For example, in handling compressed image sources, you may keep a MRU cache of decompressed images and decompress sources on the fly and discard old ones to conserve memory.

    For the raster source to be effective, you must at least specify the acquire and release callbacks which are used to retrieve the pixel data for the region of interest and demark when it can be freed afterwards. Other callbacks are provided for when the pattern is copied temporarily during rasterisation, or more permanently as a snapshot in order to keep the pixel data available for printing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    >>> content (Content)\n
    Content type for the pixel data that will be returned. Knowing the content type ahead of time is used for analysing the operation and picking the appropriate rendering path.

class RecordingSurface(Surface):
    """
    Creates a RecordingSurface which can be used to record all drawing operations at the highest level (that is, the level of paint, mask, stroke, fill and show_text_glyphs). The RecordingSurface can then be “replayed” against any target surface by using it as a source to drawing operations.

    The recording phase of the RecordingSurface is careful to snapshot all necessary objects (paths, patterns, etc.), in order to achieve accurate replay.

    New in version 1.11.0.

    A RecordingSurface is a surface that records all drawing operations at the highest level of the surface backend interface, (that is, the level of paint, mask, stroke, fill, and show_text_glyphs). The recording surface can then be “replayed” against any target surface by using it as a source surface.

    If you want to replay a surface so that the results in target will be identical to the results that would have been obtained if the original operations applied to the recording surface had instead been applied to the target surface, you can use code like this:
    >>> cr = cairo.Context(target)
    >>> cr.set_source_surface(recording_surface, 0.0, 0.0)
    >>> cr.paint()\n

    A RecordingSurface is logically unbounded, i.e. it has no implicit constraint on the size of the drawing surface. However, in practice this is rarely useful as you wish to replay against a particular target surface with known bounds. For this case, it is more efficient to specify the target extents to the recording surface upon creation.

    The recording phase of the recording surface is careful to snapshot all necessary objects (paths, patterns, etc.), in order to achieve accurate replay.

    Parameters
    ----------
    >>> content (cairo.Content)\n
    The content for the new surface.
    >>> rectangle (cairo.Rectangle or None)\n
    `Rectangle` that bound the recorded operations, or `None` to record unbounded operations.
