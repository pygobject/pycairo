Alternatives:

* `cairocffi <https://doc.courtbouillon.org/cairocffi/>`__ provides a large subset of
  the pycairo API but instead of being implemented in C it uses `cffi
  <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/>`__ to talk to cairo. In case you'd prefer not
  to use a C extension then give this a try. Or if you use PyPy and want to
  benefit from the lower overhead of cffi compared to C extensions.
* `Qahirah <https://github.com/ldo/qahirah>`__ provides a more "pythonic" API
  with less focus on matching the cairo C API. It also isn't a C extension and
  uses the Python builtin `ctypes
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`__ module to talk to cairo.
