Pycairo - Python bindings for cairo
http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo

Dependencies
------------
    cairo  		>= 1.2.6
    Python 		>= 2.3

Not required, but supported if they are detected:
    Numeric Python	any version (?)
    PyGTK		2.2.0 <= version < 2.7.0

PyGTK and the cairo.gtk module:
PyGTK 2.8 and above has built in support for cairo and does not need to use the
cairo.gtk module. The cairo.gtk module is deprecated and will be removed from
a future version of pycairo.

Compiling
---------
See the INSTALL document for build instructions.

Documentation
-------------
Currently there is no Python specific cairo API documentation. However there
is the cairo C documentation which can be useful. There is also a NOTES file
in the tarball release which lists how Pycairo differs from the cairo C API,
and there are Pycairo examples in the examples/ directory of the tarball
release.
